Hello. As you may or may not know I'm a junior developer. And what it comes with that phrase is that I don't have too much experience.
But I have motivation, and willingness.
So, at the begining of this journey I was alone at home, and trying to learn stuff. But when you are alone and you don't know how to do the stuff you want to do, it could be really frustrating. Then I was lucky enough to be selected to do a 2-month bootcamp to learn to code (<a href="https://www.lewagon.com">Le Wagon</a>). And it was wonderful, because they are really nice people teaching a bunch of nice people how to learn to learn to code. And not, that was not a typo. At Le Wagon I learn to code, but the most important thing that I learned there it was the method "bootcamp" to learn to code. That is, briefly: code everyday.

So after the end of the bootcamp I was really into coding and coding everyday. And then the frustration came. Because when you are a 2-month-old baby-developer you dream big, but you know a small amount of stuff, and if you want to -let's say "ride a bike"- ... so if you want to ride a bike with your coding skills, you will probably fell down. And it's going to hurt. Because, remember, you are just a 2-month-old baby developer. And who-on-earth will put a 2-month-old baby on a bike? Nobody. So what you do with your baby developer skills to fight this impostor-syndrom thing which is taking your heart and making you stare at the big skills that job offers are claiming for and other people is doing in front you ? Bah, you code, you just keep coding.

So, what's THE thing that everyone wants to learn and keep improving ? Javascript. Because Javascript is all the nice and cool things people do on the internet. You know, all the effects of thing moving, clocks ticking and stuff. That's Javascript, folks!
 <a href="https://javascript30.com/">Javascript 30</a>) is a FREE 30-day challenge with videos and exercises to be solved. All done by a very nice guy which explains all of this to you in videos.

So in this post-series I will show you the stuff I'm learning with this challenge.

See you soon !


<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: -->

<!-- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
