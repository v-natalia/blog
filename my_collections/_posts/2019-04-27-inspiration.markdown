Hi there !

Here another short post while I'm TAing. Just 3 links to stuff that inspires me.

#1 If you have kids, this TED talk could bring some enlightening to your parent life, and if you are not a parent, but you are a teacher or a friend of someone else... (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve"> The power of believing that you can improve</a>)

Little spoiler: "Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting 'A's? Are we raising kids who don't know how to dream big dreams? Their biggest goal is getting the next A, or the next test score?"


#2 (<a href="https://www.netflix.com/fr/title/80114460"> Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things</a>)


#3 (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability"> The power of vulnerability</a>)

A very popular Ted Talk in the circle of innovation, this researcher talks about vulnerability and courage.
