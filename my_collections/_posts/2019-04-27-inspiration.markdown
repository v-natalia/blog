Hi there !

Here another short post while I'm working as a TA, because I have no time to do my challenge :(. Just 3 links to stuff that inspires me.

#1 <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve"> The power of believing that you can improve</a>

If you have kids, this TED talk could bring some enlightening to your parent life, and if you are not a parent, but you are a teacher or a friend of someone else...
Little spoiler: "Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting 'A's? Are we raising kids who don't know how to dream big dreams? Their biggest goal is getting the next A, or the next test score?"


#2 <a href="https://www.netflix.com/fr/title/80114460"> Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things</a>

I don't want to have things, I think that I have more things that what I can handle, and that brings stress to my life. When I saw this documentary I was already trying to have less. But it is always interesting to know that I'm not the only one.

#3 <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability"> The power of vulnerability</a>

A very popular Tedx talk, Bren√© Brown is a researcher talks about vulnerability, connection, sense of love and belonging, wholeheartedness and courage.
Two years later she did a Ted talk on <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_listening_to_shame
"> Listening to shame</a>.
A little secret: I started this blog after listening to their talks.

Some highlights:
- "Vulnerability is not weakness",
- "Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change."
- "Shame, for women, is this web of unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations about who we're supposed to be."
- "If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment. If you put the same amount in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can't survive."
