Hi again !
I'm applying to developer jobs at the moment and in this post I'm making a statement -a kind of bottle sent to the sea- because I hope that someday a recruiter will ask me one or two of these questions.

#1 Are you a morning or an evening person ?
#2 How did you see yourself 5 years ago and how different you are now from that image ? (actually 2 questions in 1)
#3 Why do you wanted to become a fullstack developer ?
#4 How do you prefer your coffee ?
#5 What is your favorite website ?
